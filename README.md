## Levels

### Level 1 - Crop Insurance

A farmer is tasked to transport crops, but there are fire obstacles that the farmer needs to overcome to advance to the next level. In order to extinguish the fire, the farmer must not only meet with a COUNTRY Financial agent to purchase a crop insurance policy, but he must also collect at least 12 crop items. 

### Level 2 - Medical Insurance

Another character is exploring the city. However, the city is filled with people infected with a contagious virus, and the character needs to avoid these sick people. In the case of the character contracting this virus, the character must not only meet with a COUNTRY Financial agent to purchase a medical insurance policy, but the character must also collect at least 12 pill items.

### Level 3 - Car Insurance

The character is walking on the streets while surrounded by reckless drivers, and he needs to avoid them.
